One-sided communication: synchronization
========================================

.. questions::

   - What are the pitfalls of RMA?
   - How can we make RMA safe and correct?

.. objectives::

   - Active synchronization: |term-MPI_Win_fence|, |term-MPI_Win_post|, |term-MPI_Win_start|, |term-MPI_Win_complete|, |term-MPI_Win_wait|
   - Passive synchronization: |term-MPI_Win_lock|, |term-MPI_win_unlock|

      Steve and Alice are joined by Martha. It is not really clear which value
      Alice will find in the memory window!


Epochs
------

In the last episode, we introduced the concept of *epochs* in one-sided
communication.  Recall that an **epoch** is the execution span occurring between
calls to MPI synchronization functions.
Calls to |term-MPI_Put|, |term-MPI_Get|, and |term-MPI_Accumulate| must be
encapsulated within an **access epoch** for the memory window.
Multiple data transfers can occur within the same epoch, amortizing the
performance downsides of synchronization operations.

.. figure:: img/E02-RMA_timeline-coarse.svg
   :align: center

   The timeline of window creation, calls to RMA routines, and synchronization
   in an application which uses MPI one-sided communication.
   The creation of ``MPI_Win`` objects in each process in the communicator
   allows the execution of RMA routines. Each access to the window must be
   synchronized: to ensure safety and correctness of the application.
   Note that **any** interaction with the memory window **must** be protected by
   calls to synchronization routines: even local load/store and/or two-sided
   communication.
   The events in between synchronization calls are said to happen in *epochs*,
   here represented by vertical purple lines.


Some general rules:

- *Any* call to RMA communication functions that take a ``MPI_Win`` object as
  argument, *must* occur within an access epoch.
- Memory windows at a given process can be featured in multiple epochs, as long
  as the epochs *do not* overlap. Conversely, epochs on distinct memory windows
  can overlap.
- Local and non-RMA MPI operations are safe within an epoch.


Active target communication
---------------------------

In active target communication, the synchronization happens both on the origin
and the target process.

.. figure:: img/E03-active_target_communication.svg
   :align: center

   The origin process issues both synchronization and data movement calls. The
   target also issues synchronization calls, hence the name active target
   communication.  Synchronization on the target process starts the **exposure
   epoch** of its memory window.  Synchronization on the origin process starts
   the **access epoch** on the target's memory window.  Once the origin process
   has completed its RMA operations, the programmer must take care to
   synchronize once more on the origin to  close the access epoch. The exposure
   epoch is closed by yet another synchronization call on the target process.


The structure of an epoch assumes more fine-grained detail:

- An **exposure epoch** is enclosed within synchronization calls by the target
  process. The target process makes known to potential origin processes the
  availability of its memory window.
- An **access epoch** is enclosed within synchronization calls by the origin
  process. There can be *multiple* access epochs within the same exposure epoch.


Exposure and access epochs can be interleaved and overlapped, with few *caveats*:

- A process' memory window can be in multiple exposure epochs, as long as these
  are disjoint.
- An exposure epoch for a process' memory window may overlap with exposure
  epochs on other windows.
- An exposure epoch for a process' memory window may overlap with access epochs
  for the same or other ``MPI_Win`` window objects.


Fence
^^^^^

Using a fence is possibly the easiest way to realize the active target
communication paradigm. These synchronization calls are collective within the
communicator underlying the window object.

.. figure:: img/E03-fence.svg
   :align: center

   You can enclose RMA communication within calls to |term-MPI_Win_fence|. This
   is a collective operation on the window object: on the origin process, it
   opens (closes) the *access* epoch; on the target process, it opens (closes)
   the *exposure* epoch.


RMA communication calls are surrounded by |term-MPI_Win_fence| calls.  This
collective operation opens *and* closes an access epoch at an origin process and
an exposure epoch at a target process.  Calls to |term-MPI_Win_fence| act
similarly to barriers: the MPI implementation will synchronize the sequence of
RMA calls occurring between two fences.

During an exposure epoch:

- You should *not* perform local accesses to the memory window.
- Only one remote process can issue |term-MPI_Put|.
- There can be mutiple |term-MPI_Accumulate| function calls.


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_fence|

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_fence(int assert,
                        MPI_Win win)


.. parameters::

   ``assert``
       Use this argument to provide optimization *hints* to the MPI library.
       Setting this argument to ``0`` is always correct.
   ``win``
       The window object.


Post/Start/Complete/Wait
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of |term-MPI_Win_fence| can pose constraints on RMA communication and,
since it's a collective operation, might incur performance penalties.  Imagine,
for example, that you created a window object in a communicator with :math:`N`
processes, but that only pairs of processes do RMA operations. Fencing these
operations will force the *whole* communicator to synchronize, even though in
reality only the interacting pairs should do so.

MPI enables you to have more fine-grained control than fences over synchronization.
Exposure epochs on target processes can be opened and closed with:

- |term-MPI_Win_post|,
- |term-MPI_Win_wait| or |term-MPI_Win_test|,

while opening and closing of access epochs on origin processes is enabled by:

- |term-MPI_Win_start|,
- |term-MPI_Win_complete|.


.. figure:: img/E03-pscw.svg
   :align: center

   Any process can issue a call to |term-MPI_Win_post| to initiate an exposure
   epoch for a specific group of processes.  The access epoch starts with a call
   to |term-MPI_Win_start| and end with a call to |term-MPI_Win_complete|.
   The exposure epoch is closed with |term-MPI_Win_wait| (or |term-MPI_Win_test|).
   Exposure and access epochs must pertain to *matching* process groups.  The
   programmer has to explicitly manage the pairing of exposure and access epochs
   in this model: all communications partners should be known.
   With the Post/Start/Complete/Wait calls, MPI lets you implement active target
   communication with *weak synchronization*: the call to |term-MPI_Win_start|
   is not required to happen chronologically before the call to
   |term-MPI_Win_post|.


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_post|

   Start an *exposure* epoch for the memory window on the local calling process.
   Only the processes in the given group should originate RMA calls.
   Each process in the origin group has to issue a matching |term-MPI_Win_start|
   call.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_post(MPI_Group group,
                       int assert,
                       MPI_Win win)


.. parameters::

   ``group``
       The group of **origin** processes in this exposure epoch.
   ``assert``
       Use this argument to provide optimization *hints* to the MPI library.
       Setting this argument to ``0`` is always correct.
   ``win``
       The window object.


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_start|

   Start an *access* epoch for the given window object. Only the processes in
   the given group can be targeted by RMA calls.
   Each process in the origin group has to issue a matching |term-MPI_Win_post|
   call.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_start(MPI_Group group,
                        int assert,
                        MPI_Win win)


.. parameters::

   ``group``
       The group of **target** processes in this access epoch.
   ``assert``
       Use this argument to provide optimization *hints* to the MPI library.
       Setting this argument to ``0`` is always correct.
   ``win``
       The window object.


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_complete|

   Calling this function, we can end the access epoch.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_complete(MPI_Win win)


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_wait|

   This function finalizes the exposure epoch.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_wait(MPI_Win win)


.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_test|

   Nonblocking version of |term-MPI_Win_wait|. The output parameter ``flag``
   will be set to true if a call to |term-MPI_Win_wait| would return, thus
   finalizing the exposure epoch.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_test(MPI_Win win,
                       int *flag)


.. parameters::

   ``win``
       The window object.
   ``flag``
       Whether the exposure epoch has ended.


Passive target communication
----------------------------

This communication paradigm is conceptually close to the shared memory model:
the memory managed by the window object is globally accessible to all process in
the communicator. This is also called a "billboard" model.


.. figure:: img/E03-passive_target_communication.svg
   :align: center

   In passive target communication, data movement and synchronization are
   orchestrated by the origin process alone. The programmer will use
   |term-MPI_Win_lock| and |term-MPI_Win_unlock| to achieve passive target
   communication.  Calls to these functions delimit the access epochs. There are
   no exposure epochs in passive target communication.

Passive target communication can pose challenges for program portability and
should only be used when the memory managed by window object has been allocated
with:

- |term-MPI_Alloc_mem|,
- |term-MPI_Win_allocate|,
- ``MPI_Win_attach``.



.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_lock|

   This function starts an RMA access epoch by locking access to the memory
   window on the given rank.
   We can have exclusive access to the memory window on ``rank`` by using a
   ``MPI_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE`` lock. With ``MPI_LOCK_SHARED`` multiple processes can
   access the rank's memory window: this is unsafe in combination with multiple
   |term-MPI_Put| calls.

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_lock(int lock_type,
                       int rank,
                       int assert,
                       MPI_Win win)


.. parameters::

   ``lock_type``
       Which lock to apply. Can be either ``MPI_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE`` or ``MPI_LOCK_SHARED``.
   ``rank``
       The rank whose memory window should be locked.
   ``assert``
       Use this argument to provide optimization *hints* to the MPI library.
       Setting this argument to ``0`` is always correct.
   ``win``
       The window object.

.. signature:: |term-MPI_Win_unlock|

   .. code-block:: c

      int MPI_Win_unlock(int rank,
                         MPI_Win win)


.. parameters::

   ``rank``
       The rank whose memory window should be unlocked.
   ``win``
       The window object.
