One-sided communication: synchronization
========================================

.. questions::

   - What are the pitfalls of RMA?
   - How can we make RMA safe and correct?

.. objectives::

   - Active synchronization: |term-MPI_Win_fence|, |term-MPI_Win_post|, |term-MPI_Win_start|, |term-MPI_Win_complete|, |term-MPI_Win_wait|
   - Passive synchronization: |term-MPI_Win_lock|, |term-MPI_win_unlock|

Active synchronization
