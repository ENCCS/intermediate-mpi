First iteration: 2020-12-08/11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First iteration of this workshop was given as 4 x (almost) 4 hours, that is 4 half days.

We had two main 30-minutes lectures each day. Each lecture included type-alongs and was followed by ample time for questions and live-coding demos.
Each day was concluded with exercises and a wrap-up.
